        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Check out some of the projects I’ve worked on during my CS coursework and internships:</p>
        <!-- You can optionally link to GitHub repositories here -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> COMP541: Ledge Quest – In this project, I designed and implemented a game simulation using the MIPS assembly language, a challenge that required a deep 
                understanding of low-level computational processes and system architecture. My game, crafted around the mechanics of gravity and collision detection, involved intricate planning 
                and precise execution, showcasing my ability to translate complex game dynamics into the meticulous and constrained environment of assembly language programming. I am particularly 
                proud of this project because it not only pushed my technical skills to their limits but also demanded creativity and problem-solving in an environment where resources are minimal 
                and efficiency is paramount. Overcoming the challenges of direct hardware manipulation and optimizing performance without the aid of high-level abstractions was immensely satisfying. 
                The successful integration of components like collision detection, gravity effects, and dynamic object interaction into the MIPS architecture stands as a testament to my growing capabilities as a programmer.</li>
            <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> COMP590: MyCSXL – 2. The CSXL, or Computer Science Experience Labs, at UNC Chapel Hill provides a physical space where students 
                can engage with their computer science community. An accompanying web application enhances this experience by enabling students to manage reservations and network with peers. 
                One significant enhancement, MyCSXL, allows students to send and manage friend requests, fostering connections within the computer science department. This feature is critical 
                for building a network of peers and mentors, directly impacting students’ professional and academic growth. Technically, MyCSXL utilizes Angular and TypeScript on the frontend, 
                creating a seamless and visually appealing interface that includes search functionalities, friend management, and real-time updates. The backend is powered by Python and FastAPI, 
                interacting with PostgreSQL databases to handle complex data relationships and ensuring efficient data management and security.</li>
        </ul>
